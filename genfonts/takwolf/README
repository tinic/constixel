If you want to use JP/KO/ZH_CH/ZH_HK/ZH_TR/ZH_TW pixel fonts for your embedded 
projects, I recommend the excellent fonts from TakWolf:

https://github.com/TakWolf/ark-pixel-font
https://github.com/TakWolf/fusion-pixel-font
https://github.com/TakWolf/ark-pixel-font-inherited
https://github.com/TakWolf/hzk-pixel-font
https://github.com/TakWolf/winxp-pixel-font

Warning:

- The complete ark-pixel 12px font clocks in at around 700Kb in your binary.
- The fusion-pixel at 12px is about 1Mb.
- The WinXP fonts are even larger...

Requirements:

- Bash 4.0+ (On MacOS use homebrew to install a newer bash)
- gcc-14 or newer, or clang
- harfbuzz (Debian: libharfbuzz-dev MacOS(homebrew): harfbuzz )
- freetype2 (Debian: libfreetype-dev MacOS(homebrew): freetype )

Instructions:

- Get the otf versions from the above links and place the otf files in this directory.
- From a terminal 
    > cd constixel/genfonts
    > ./build_fonts_takwolf.sh
- This will generate the header files which are placed in constixel/fonts
